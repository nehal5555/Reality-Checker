## Introduction

The proliferation of fake news poses a significant challenge to informed decision-making. This project aims to address this issue by providing a tool that can help users identify potentially fake news articles.  The website uses a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze the text of a news article and predict its likelihood of being fake.  It's important to note that this tool provides a prediction, and should not be considered the sole determinant of an article's truthfulness.  Critical thinking and fact-checking are always recommended.

## Features

* **Text Input:** Users can paste the text of a news article into a text box.
* **Prediction:** The website uses the trained model to analyze the input text and provides a prediction of "fake" or "real".
* **Confidence Score (Optional):** The website may also display a confidence score indicating the model's certainty in its prediction.
* **Clear Interface:**  A simple and intuitive user interface makes the tool easy to use.
* **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially a framework like React, Vue, or Angular)
* **Backend:** Python (Flask or Django), or Node.js (Express)
* **Machine Learning:** Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)
* **Model Deployment:** (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud)
* **Database (Optional):** (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) - If you plan to store data.
